    "- The data here is based on fellows' information scrapped from the Insight data science program website\n",
    "- It is important to note that the information about projects and companies are very limited (e.g. only title information can be retrieved for projects and the only information we get for companies are their name).\n",
    "- I've chosen a very quick and dirty way of creating features from the company name (i.e. via wikipedia summary) because my current requirements are for this to be fast, free and easy (e.g. no registration, payment or api key, etc). There are many better ways to get information about companies that are complete and well-structured but they don't meet the requirements above."

Further, \"find\" is related to \"local\" and \"place\", \"predict\" is related to \"forecast\", and \"recommend\" is related to \"movie\", \"video\", \"love\" and \"like\". These words make sense together.\n",
    "- Increasing n_comps to 4 or 5 also gives us relatively independent topics that seem to make sense: (a) \"topics\" and \"news\" and (b) \"stack\", \"overflow\" and \"help\"\n",
    "- Increasing the number of topics even further (e.g. n_comps = 10) tend to give us overlapping top words (e.g. \"place\" appears in the top words for topics 1, 6 and 10 when n_comps =10). It appears that the differences between these three topics are now in the way \"place\" is related to other content (i.e. places to walk your dog, versus places related to favourite restaurants, versus places to avoid that is related to crime in order to stay safe)"

    "### 2.3.2b. As can be observed in the above plots, there doesn't appear to be any relationship between company themes (across any number of company_info components) and the five different Project topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the presence of possible relationships (which there are likely none), we might expect the different company themes to be selectively distributed across the Project topics. However, we can see that they are instead quite evenly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that a lot of information is lost when we try to force a dominant topic for each Project or Company based on the topic with the largest weight as I did above. It is possible that while Project and Company may be related, this relationship may be different from what was captured by the latent topics formed by NMF.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this is unlikely, due to many limitations in the data (e.g. The only information we have for Projects are their names; there was a lot of noise in the company_info column, etc). However, just for the sake of completion I'm going to perform machine learning below to see the extent to which machine learning might be able to relate Project (just the bag of words, to lessen dimensionality reduction) to the different Company themes. Based on my above observations, I really don't think that they will perform well. However, by calculating accuracy we can quantify very quickly across the different Company nmf sizes the general performance to see if there are any relationships that might have been overlooked in the snapshot above. Also, to reduce reliance on any one ML method, I'm going to look at accuracies for linearSVC and logistic regression."

    "As observed, Projects can be separated into topics quite nicely using NMF. Further, based on feature-engineering Company names into company information, I was also able to divide them into topics. However, a lot of company information included location names. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand (and as expected for various reasons elaborated on before), I did not find a relationship between Projects and Company. Also, given that I was trying to relate company information to Project names that were usually irrelevant of locations, having location names in the company information made it noisier. It might be better to get company information such as industry information and their products, etc, in future when looking to feature-engineer based on Company names."
